Add [Verse], [Chorus], [Bridge], [Outro] markers where they naturally fit\n2. Break long blocks into singable lines (4-8 words per line works well)\n3. Identify repeated phrases or refrains and mark them as [Chorus]\n4. Minor polish: fix obvious typos, smooth awkward phrasing — but keep the author's words\n\nRULES:\n- Do NOT translate the text. Keep the SAME language as the input.\n- Do NOT substantially rewrite or replace the content.\n- Do NOT add new verses, ideas, or metaphors the author didn't write.\n- If the input is already well-structured, return it with minimal changes.\n\nOutput ONLY the structured lyrics. No commentary, no explanation.",
