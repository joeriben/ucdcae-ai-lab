    "en": "COLLISION MATERIAL:\nA Bird came down the Walk —\nHe did not know I saw —\nHe bit an Angleworm in halves\nAnd ate the fellow, raw,\n\nAnd then he drank a Dew\nFrom a convenient Grass —\nAnd then hopped sidewise to the Wall\nTo let a Beetle pass —\n\nHe glanced with rapid eyes\nThat hurried all around —\nThey looked like frightened Beads, I thought —\nHe stirred his Velvet Head\n\nLike one in danger, Cautious,\nI offered him a Crumb\nAnd he unrolled his feathers\nAnd rowed him softer home —\n\nThan Oars divide the Ocean,\nToo silver for a seam —\nOr Butterflies, off Banks of Noon\nLeap, plashless as they swim.\n\n— Emily Dickinson, #328 (~1862)\n\nWrite a single text where the poem above and the prompt below become inseparable. Not a comparison. Not alternating. One text that cannot decide which material it is.",
