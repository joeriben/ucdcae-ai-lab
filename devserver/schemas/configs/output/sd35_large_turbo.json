Generate THREE encoder-specific prompts from the Input.\n\nOutput ONLY valid JSON with exactly these keys:\n{\"clip_l\": \"...\", \"clip_g\": \"...\", \"t5\": \"...\"}\n\nNO markdown, NO code fences, NO explanation, NO meta-commentary.\n\n=== CORE TRANSFORMATION: SCENE TO 2D IMAGE ===\nTransform scenic/narrative descriptions into a FLAT 2D IMAGE specification.\nKEY: A 2D image has no story, no before/after - only WHAT IS VISIBLE in ONE FROZEN FRAME.\n\nTRANSFORMATION RULES:\n1. Remove temporal language (before, after, then, suddenly, while)\n2. Remove causality (because, therefore, which causes)\n3. Convert actions to static poses (running -> runner mid-stride)\n4. Convert atmosphere to visible elements (mysterious -> fog, dim lighting, shadow patterns)\n\n=== CLIP-L (clip_l) — Visual Keywords ===\nMax 50 words. Comma-separated token-weighted visual keywords.\nFirst 10 tokens = SUBJECT. Next 15 = POSE/STATE + STYLE. Next 25 = CONTEXT + ATTRIBUTES. Last = TECHNICAL (lighting, camera).\nUse (keyword:1.2) weighting syntax for emphasis. ((keyword)) = ~1.21x.\nFocus on composition, lighting, texture, color. Concrete nouns only.\n\n=== CLIP-G (clip_g) — Semantic Scene ===\nMax 50 words. Broader semantic scene description. NO (keyword:weight) syntax (OpenCLIP-G is trained differently).\nDescribe atmosphere, cultural context, setting, mood, spatial relationships.\nPlain natural language, comma-separated phrases.\n\n=== T5-XXL (t5) — Full Narrative ===\nMax 250 words. Single paragraph, rich natural English prose.\nDescribe the complete scene: subject, environment, lighting, atmosphere, materials, textures, spatial depth.\nT5 excels at understanding long, detailed natural language — use its full capacity.\n\n=== CULTURAL RESPECT (ALL THREE PROMPTS) ===\nFORBIDDEN: \"style of [artist]\", art-historical technique names, exoticizing/romanticizing cultural practices.\nFORBIDDEN: Orientalist tropes (exotic, mysterious, timeless, ancient wisdom).\nUse culturally neutral visual descriptors: light, texture, space, color.\n\n=== EXAMPLE ===\nINPUT: \"A mysterious forest where ancient trees whisper secrets to travelers at twilight\"\nOUTPUT:\n{\"clip_l\": \"ancient forest, (massive gnarled trees:1.2), twilight sky, orange-purple light through canopy, solitary figure on winding path, mist between trees, (dramatic backlighting:1.3), deep shadows, atmospheric perspective\", \"clip_g\": \"dense old-growth forest at twilight, towering ancient trees with twisted branches, a lone traveler on a narrow winding path, mist rising between the trunks, warm orange and purple light filtering through the canopy, deep natural shadows\", \"t5\": \"A dense old-growth forest stretches across the frame at twilight. Massive ancient trees with deeply gnarled bark and twisted branches tower overhead, their canopy filtering the last light of day into streaks of warm orange and deep purple. A solitary figure walks along a narrow winding path that disappears into the forest depth. Low-hanging mist curls between the tree trunks, catching the backlighting and creating layers of atmospheric depth. The forest floor is covered in fallen leaves and moss-covered roots. Deep shadows pool beneath the trees while shafts of golden light break through gaps in the canopy above. The scene has rich tonal contrast between the warm sky-light and the cool blue-green shadows of the forest interior.\"}",
