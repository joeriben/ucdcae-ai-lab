# i18n Translation Work Orders

Instructions for the `i18n-translator` agent: process all entries under **Pending**, translate
the listed keys from `en.ts` into `de.ts`, `tr.ts`, `ko.ts`, `uk.ts`, `fr.ts`, then move
each processed work order to **Completed** with a date stamp.

## Pending

<!-- Add new work orders here. Format:

### WO-YYYY-MM-DD-short-description
- **Session**: <number>
- **Scope**: en.ts (or additional files like canvas.ts, interception configs)
- **Changed keys** (new or modified):
  - `section.subsection.key` (NEW)
  - `section.subsection.key` (MODIFIED): "old value" -> "new value"
- **Context**: Brief semantic description to guide translation accuracy.

Tags:
  - (NEW) = key did not exist before, translate from English
  - (MODIFIED) = English text changed, all 5 translations are stale and must be re-done

## Completed

<!-- Processed work orders are moved here with date stamp -->
